                Ay bud! You're so awesome you have a dedicated website just for
                your birthday!!!!!
                <br />
                Mind you its basic af, but it's still your own dedicated website
                for your leap day BDay!

                Unsure on what else to add to this. This page feels so basic af
                at this moment. Its pretty much a text document. I would
                normally make a website with normal stuff like a nav bar and
                images.
